## 1. The Andromeda Algorithm Change

### What Happened
In late 2024/early 2025, Meta rolled out Andromeda - a complete overhaul of the ad delivery engine. The old targeting systems advertisers relied on for years were effectively replaced.

### Impact
- Narrow targeting, lookalike audiences, and complex campaign structures stopped working
- Campaigns optimized the old way saw costs double and conversions crash
- **Creative now acts as the primary signal for targeting** - Meta uses your ad creative to determine who should see it

### What Works Now
| Old Approach (Broken) | New Approach (Working) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Narrow interest targeting | Broad targeting (entire country) |
| Lookalike audiences | Audiences over 10M people |
| Complex campaign structures | Simple structure (1 campaign, 1 ad set) |
| Testing minor ad variations | 8-15 genuinely different ad concepts |
| Manual optimization | Trusting Advantage+ automation |

---

## 2. Top Performing Ad Formats

### Video (Reels/Stories)
- **Optimal length:** 7-15 seconds
- **Aspect ratio:** 4:5 performs up to 15% better than square in feeds
- UGC-style with natural lighting, quick hooks, subtitles
- Drama-led scripts and interview formats outperform casual content
- Motion graphics highlighting product features in first 2 seconds

### Carousel Ads
- **35% higher CTR** than single-image ads
- **30% higher CTR** than video ads
- Up to 10x more traffic than traditional static ads
- First card is your hook - displays by default in feed
- Each card can link to unique landing page

### Static Images
- Still work best for **retargeting and awareness refreshes**
- Text-only ads (static images with only text, no photos) are trending
- Less effective for prospecting in 2025

### Flexible Ads
- Allow Meta to mix and match creatives based on user preferences
- Greater staying power for long-term performance
- Dynamic headers and product endorsements show 7.5-9.6% higher conversions

---

## 3. Hook Strategies & Patterns

### The 3-Second Rule
- 73% of ecommerce video ads fail within the first 3 seconds
- People spend 1.7 seconds on mobile content, 2.5 seconds on desktop
- Your hook must instantly grab attention

### High-Converting Hook Types

**Problem-Solution Hook**
> "Struggling with [pain point]? Here's what changed everything..."

**TikTok Comment Skeptic**
> Display negative comment overlay, then have creator respond directly

**"People Always Ask Me" Format**
> Leverages trending format with product integration

**Before-After Hook**
> Visual transformation that grabs attention immediately

**Question Hook**
> "What's the one product parents wish they'd bought sooner?"

**Controversial Hook**
> "Your living room isn't as cozy as you think—it's missing this."

**FOMO Hook**
> "This bestseller is flying off the shelves—grab yours before it's gone!"

### What to Track
- If competitors repeat certain hooks across multiple videos, those are worth testing
- "Stop scrolling if..." and "This changed my workflow" intros are proven
