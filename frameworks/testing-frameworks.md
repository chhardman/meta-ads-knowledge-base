# Meta Ads Testing Frameworks

> Systematic testing is essential in 2025. Creative accounts for 70% of success - test strategically to find winners.

---

## The 2025 Testing Landscape

### Key Changes
- Meta now has built-in Creative Testing feature
- A/B tests prevent overlap (each person sees only one ad)
- Highest Volume bid strategy required for testing
- Dedicate **no more than 20%** of budget to testing

### Testing Philosophy
> "Test with significant differences, not subtle variations."
> Make sure differences between ads are meaningful - different formats, themes, personas, and messaging angles.

## Framework 1: The 3-Phase Testing Funnel

### Phase 1: Concept Testing (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Find winning creative concepts

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Budget | 10-20% of total |
| Variations | 8-15 genuinely different concepts |
| Metrics | Hook rate, CTR, CPM |
| Kill Criteria | No traction in 24-48 hours |

**What to Test:**
- Different formats (UGC vs. polished)
- Different angles (problem vs. benefit)
- Different customer personas
- Different value propositions

### Phase 2: Hook/Element Testing (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Optimize winning concepts

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Budget | 15% of total |
| Variations | 3-5 per winning concept |
| Metrics | Hook rate, watch time, CTR |
| Timeframe | 5-7 days per test |

**What to Test:**
- Different opening hooks (same content)
- Different CTAs
- Different text overlays
- Different thumbnails

### Phase 3: Scale Testing (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Find scale potential

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Budget | Remaining budget |
| Platform | Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns |
| Metrics | CPA, ROAS, scale ceiling |
| Action | Move winners to main campaigns |

## Framework 2: The Isolation Method

Test ONE variable at a time for clear learnings.

### Example: Hook Testing
| Ad | Hook | Body | CTA | Visual |
|----|------|------|-----|--------|
| A | "Struggling with acne?" | Same | Same | Same |
| B | "Clear skin in 14 days" | Same | Same | Same |
| C | "I tried everything..." | Same | Same | Same |

### Variables to Isolate
1. **Hook/Opening** - First 3 seconds or headline
2. **Format** - Video vs. static vs. carousel
3. **Angle** - Problem vs. benefit vs. social proof
4. **CTA** - Shop Now vs. Learn More vs. custom
5. **Creator** - Different UGC creators
6. **Length** - 7 sec vs. 15 sec vs. 30 sec

## Framework 3: Meta's Built-in Creative Testing

### Setup Requirements
- Highest Volume bid strategy (required)
- Daily budget (lifetime not supported)
- Up to 5 creatives per test
- 20% max budget allocation recommended

### How to Use
1. Create ad set with test creatives
2. Enable "Creative Testing" toggle
3. Meta distributes spend evenly
4. Each user sees only one variation
5. Statistical significance calculated automatically

### Best Practices
- Significant creative differences only
- Run for minimum 7 days
- Don't judge before statistical significance
- Move winners to scaled campaigns

## Framework 4: The Weekly Testing Calendar

### Sustainable Testing Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| **Monday** | Review last week's data, identify winners/losers |
| **Tuesday** | Kill underperformers, scale winners |
| **Wednesday** | Brief new creative concepts |
| **Thursday** | Creative production |
| **Friday** | Launch 5-10 new test creatives |
| **Weekend** | Let tests run, collect data |

### Monthly Cadence
- **Week 1:** Concept testing (broad)
- **Week 2:** Hook/element testing (refinement)
- **Week 3:** Scale testing (winners)
- **Week 4:** Refresh + new concepts

## Framework 6: The Kill/Scale Decision Tree

```
Is the ad getting impressions?
├── NO → Check targeting/bid strategy
└── YES → Check Hook Rate (25%+ target)
    ├── Below 20% → Kill within 24-48 hours
    └── Above 20% → Check CTR (0.9%+ target)
        ├── Below 0.7% → Kill or test new hooks
        └── Above 0.9% → Check CPA
            ├── Above target → Optimize or kill
            └── At/below target → SCALE
```

### Kill Criteria
- Hook rate below 20% after 500+ impressions
- CTR below 0.5% after 1,000+ impressions
- CPA 2x+ target after $50+ spend
- No conversions after 3 days

### Scale Criteria
- CPA at or below target
- ROAS at or above target
- Consistent performance for 5+ days
- Room in audience for scale
