## The Creative Diversity System

### Why Diversity Matters
In the Andromeda era, creative acts as the primary targeting signal. You need a diverse library of assets that speak to:
- Different angles
- Different stages of the customer journey
- Different audience segments

### Minimum Creative Requirements
- **8-15 genuinely different ad concepts** per campaign
- **5-10 new creatives tested weekly**
- **Refresh every 2-4 weeks** to avoid fatigue

## Framework 1: The UGC Video Structure

**H-P-S-P-C (Hook, Problem, Solution, Proof, CTA)**

| Section | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hook** | 0-3 sec | Attention-grabbing opener |
| **Problem** | 3-7 sec | Relatable pain point |
| **Solution** | 7-12 sec | Introduce product |
| **Proof** | 12-18 sec | Show results/demo |
| **CTA** | 18-20 sec | Clear call to action |

**Example Script:**
> [HOOK] "I was spending $200/month on skincare that didn't work..."
>
> [PROBLEM] "Breakouts, dryness, nothing seemed to help."
>
> [SOLUTION] "Then I found [Product] - it's literally 3 ingredients."
>
> [PROOF] "Look at my skin now. Same lighting, no filter."
>
> [CTA] "Link is in the bio - they're doing 20% off right now."

## Framework 2: The Interview/Testimonial Format

Best for: Building trust, longer engagement, beauty/wellness products

**Structure:**
1. **Setup** (2 sec): Close-up face, authentic setting
2. **Skepticism** (3 sec): "I didn't believe it would work..."
3. **Experience** (7 sec): Walk through the journey
4. **Result** (5 sec): Share transformation
5. **Recommendation** (3 sec): Why they'd suggest it

**Pro Tips:**
- Natural lighting only
- No scripts - use bullet points for authentic delivery
- Multiple camera angles if possible

## Framework 3: The Before-After Visual

**Variations:**

|------|-------------|
| **Split Screen** | Side-by-side before/after |

| **Time-lapse** | Compressed video of change |
| **Sequential** | First card = before, second = after |

**Rules:**
- Same lighting in both shots
- Same angle/position
- Minimal editing (builds trust)
- Show the product between before/after

## Framework 4: The Product Demo

### The 4-Element Static
1. **Hero Image** - Product or lifestyle shot

3. **Value Prop** - One key benefit
4. **CTA** - Clear action

### Text-Heavy Static (Trending)

| 4:5 (Portrait) | Feed (15% better performance) |
| 9:16 (Vertical) | Stories/Reels |

## Framework 7: The Angle Matrix

Create systematic creative diversity by mixing angles and formats:

### Customer Angles
| Angle | Message Focus |
|-------|---------------|
| **Problem-Aware** | "Struggling with X?" |
| **Solution-Aware** | "There's a better way to X" |
| **Product-Aware** | "Here's why [Product] is different" |
| **Most Aware** | "You've seen us before - here's a deal" |

### Content Types
- UGC testimonial
- Brand/polished
- Educational/how-to
- Social proof compilation
- Unboxing/first impression
- Day-in-the-life

### Cross-Reference Grid
Create ads for each intersection of angle + content type = systematic creative diversity.

## Framework 8: The Hook Variation System

For every winning creative, create 3-5 hook variations:

| Original Hook | Variation Type | New Hook |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| "Struggling with acne?" | Question flip | "What if clear skin was possible?" |
| "Struggling with acne?" | Statement | "Clear skin is possible." |
| "Struggling with acne?" | Social proof | "50,000 people cleared their skin with this" |
| "Struggling with acne?" | Controversy | "Your skincare routine is making it worse" |
| "Struggling with acne?" | Personal | "I had acne for 10 years until I found this" |
