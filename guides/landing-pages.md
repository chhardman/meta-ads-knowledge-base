# Landing Page Optimization Guide

> Your ad gets the click. Your landing page gets the conversion. 90% of Meta traffic is mobile.

---

## The Landing Page Equation

```
High-Converting Landing Page =
  Message Match + Speed + Mobile-First + Clear CTA + Social Proof
```

**Key Stats:**
- 53% of mobile users abandon sites taking >3 seconds to load
- 12x lower purchase intent when optimizing for page views vs conversions
- Proper landing page alignment is often the easiest fix for poor performance

---

## The Message Match Rule

> Your landing page should mirror the promise in the ad that brought the click. Same headline. Same offer. Same tone.

**Why it matters:**
- Creates instant "I'm in the right place" feeling
- Lowers bounce rate
- Increases conversions
- Builds trust

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Headline matches ad headline/hook
- [ ] Offer is identical (same discount, same bundle)
- [ ] Visual style is consistent
- [ ] Tone/voice matches
- [ ] Product shown in ad is featured prominently

**Bad Example:**
- Ad: "Get 30% off our best-selling moisturizer"
- Landing page: Generic homepage with no mention of 30% or moisturizer

**Good Example:**
- Ad: "Get 30% off our best-selling moisturizer"
- Landing page: Dedicated page with "30% OFF" headline, moisturizer hero image, checkout button
