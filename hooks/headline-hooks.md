## Classic Copywriting Formulas

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

**Structure:**
1. **Attention:** Hook with strong headline
2. **Interest:** Share relatable pain/problem
3. **Desire:** Highlight the transformation
4. **Action:** Clear CTA

**Example:**
> **Finally, skincare that actually works.** (Attention)
>
> Tried every product on the shelf? Same. (Interest)
>
> Our customers see visible results in 14 days - or your money back. (Desire)
>
> Shop now and save 20%. (Action)

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** State the pain point
2. **Agitate:** Twist the knife
3. **Solution:** Present the answer

**Example:**
> **Waking up exhausted every morning?** (Problem)
>
> You've tried sleeping more, coffee, energy drinks... nothing works. And it's affecting everything - your work, your relationships, your life. (Agitate)
>
> Our natural energy formula changed everything for 50,000+ customers. (Solution)

**Pro Tip:** List your top 3 customer frustrations. Build mini PAS ads for each one.

### FAB (Feature, Advantage, Benefit)

**Structure:**
1. **Feature:** What it is/has
2. **Advantage:** Why that matters
3. **Benefit:** How life improves

**Example:**
> **Made with 100% organic cotton** (Feature)
>
> So it's softer and lasts 3x longer than regular shirts (Advantage)
>
> Which means you'll finally have a go-to tee that feels amazing every time (Benefit)
