## Hook Testing Framework

### What to Test
1. Different opening lines (same content)
2. Different visuals (same script)
3. Different creators (same hook)
4. Text overlay vs. spoken hook
5. Face on screen vs. product only

### Success Metrics
- **Hook Rate:** 3-second views / impressions (aim for 25%+)
- **Hold Rate:** Average watch time / video length
- **CTR:** Click-through rate (0.90-1.60% healthy)

### Testing Rules
- If hook isn't working in 24 hours, swap it out
- If you find a winner, test 3-5 variations of it
- Track which hooks competitors repeat across multiple videos
